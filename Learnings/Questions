1.	Why is control needed for the product ……………….
  •	Control is needed by managers, so that they don’t begin a task before the initial specification is clear.
  •	 Programmers must be controlled, so that they don’t invent beyond the requirements which are assigned to them. 
  •	Control must be exercised over the testing of the system, so that tests for all levels of the system, including the smallest components, have adequate
        test specifications prior to their production.

Ans : B
4.	If a system is to evolve to meet changing requirements, The characteristics it should have are……
  •	a usefully extendable system must be open-ended.
  •	It must allow each module to be isolated in an envelope(perfect documentation for each and every module).
  •	It must encourage economical reuse of existing constructs.
5.	What are the two extreme methods of including data structure in the system design are…….
  •	Attach a full description of the data structure to the data base.
  •	Represent the structure of the data entirely in the program logic.
